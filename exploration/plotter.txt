Find out what is being done to check that paper is loaded etc.

Track Enhancing
===============

dontdoit = 1 if no track enhancing, 0 if track enhancing

Run the page through the rollers a few times
Send:
  FY{dontdoit}\x03

Move Head
=========

direction = Direction to move
            01 = down  (y-)
            02 = up    (y+)
            04 = right (x+)
            08 = left  (x-)

Start move
  \x1b\x00{direction}
Stop move
  \x1b\x00\x00


Unknowns
========

Goodness knows
? = 18 for cutting, 0 for drawing
  FC{?}\x03

Goodness knows
  FJ\x03

Some sort of status?
send
  FA\x03
returns
  '    0,    0\x03'

Sent early in desktop software start
send
  TB71\x03
returns
  '    0,    0\x03'

This appears to tell the printer to zero at the machine center
Other folk seem to think this is page orientation.
  FN0\x03

Set Cutting Speed
=================

speed = int between 1 and 10 inclusive

Send:
  !{speed},0\x03

Set Cutting Force
=================

force = int between 1 and 33 inclusive

Send:
  FX{force},0\x03


Get Printer Name
================

name_string = Name of printer as a 10-char human readable string

Send:
  FG\x03

Receive:
  {name_string}\x03

Get printer status
==================

status = 0 iff ready

Send:
  \x1b\x05

Receive:
  {status}\x03


Register Plotter
================

reg_line_length = length (mm) of the corner-lines in registration marks
reg_line_thickness = thickness (mm) of the corner-lines in registration marks

registered_area_width = width (mm) of the box the registration marks demark
registered_area_height = height (mm) of the box the registration marks demark

mystery_rotation = "117,75" if default, "147,117" if inverted (which basically
                   doesn't work)... hmm

blobx = offset of the black square relative to the corner lines
bloby = offset of the black square relative to the corner lines

search = '1' if the device should search about for the reg mark,
         '' if the cutter is currently over the mark.

success = An int formatted with "%5d" (i.e. has leading spaces) which is:
          -1: No initial reg mark(?)
           0: success
           1: No bottom reg mark(?)

Send:
  // Unknown effect (I thought it was speed...)
  !10,0\x03
  // Appears to set to "native" home position
  FN0\x03
  // Set home position to the place we're about to home in on
  TB99\x03
  // Set registration line length
  TB51,{reg_line_length*20}\x03
  // If removed the carriage hits the right-side and fails
  // If set to 1, looks on the bottom right for something
  // If set to 0, just fails
  // If set to 3, does a strange slide around on the top right and fails...
  TB52,2\x03
  // Set registration line thickness
  TB53,{reg_line_thickness*20}\x03
  // Offset of corner blob, seems to default to 0,0 if ommitted
  TB54,{bloby},{blobx}\x03
  // Seems to calibrate scaling and rotation
  TB55,1\x03
  // Register a block of the given size
  TB{search}23,{registered_area_height*20},{registered_area_width*20},{mystery_rotation}\x03

Receive:
  {success}\0x03


Plotting a line (after enabling regmarks)
=========================================
width = width of drawable area (i.e. the size of the reg area)
height = height of drawable area (i.e. the size of the reg area)

pwidth = width of paper accounting for a small margin
pheight = height of paper including for a small margin

speed = int between 1 and 10 inclusive
force = int between 1 and 33 inclusive

x = coordinate relative to registration square (or that page corner if not regd)
y = coordinate relative to registration square (or that page corner if not regd)

disable_track_enhancing = 1 if not using track enhancing, 0 if using it

Send:
