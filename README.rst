This software is based on my reverse engineering of the USB protocol used by
this device and so may or may not work well or be good for the device.

I'm also developing this for my own personal use. As such that means I'm
prioritising features which matter to me (correctness, predictability,
reliability) and not those which might matter to others (ease of use, features
I don't happen to care about). I'd be delighted if you wish to use this
software or even contribute but I'd work on the principle that if you want to
use this long term you might have to maintain your own fork!
